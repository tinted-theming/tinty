# Changelog

## Unreleased


## Fixed

- Fix bugs caused by vestigial theme files in the data directory. They are now cleaned up during `tinty apply`.

## Changed

- Theme files from themeable components are now located in a new `artifacts/` in the data directory. For backwards
compatibility, symlinks are
created in the root of the data directory pointing to their new locations. These symlinks will go
away in a future Tinty release.

## [0.27.0] - 2025-03-26

### Added

- Add option to pass in `description` as a flag for `tinty generate-scheme`

## [0.26.1] - 2025-02-13

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug where scheme files ending in `.yml` weren't recognized.
- Fixed a bug where `install` subcommand gives an error for older versions of
  git

## [0.26.0] - 2025-01-18

### Added

- Support `--json` option in `tinty list`.

## [0.25.0] - 2025-01-14

### Added
 
- Support `[[items]] revision` property that accepts a tag, branch, or commit SHA1.

### Changed

- `tinty update` now keeps the items' `origin` remote URLs up-to-date.
- The item repositories are now checked out to a specific commit SHA1 in "detached HEAD" mode.

### Fixed

- Fix bug where period preceeding extension is still added to generated files even when an extension doesn't exist

## [0.24.0] - 2024-12-20

### Changed

- Update Cargo dependencies
- Update to latest tinted-scheme-extractor which alters how it adjusts
  colors slightly to ensure >= `base08` aren't too dark compared to
  `base00`

### Fixed

- In tests, use `CARGO_BIN_EXE_tinty` env var for the binary path
  instead of assuming it exists in `./target/release` directory
- Upgrade `url` crate dependency due to security vulnerability

## [0.23.0] - 2024-11-17

### Changed

- Change `tinty generate-scheme` API by removing the `OUTFILE` option
  and only printing to stdout or saving to the tinty data directory with
  the `--save` flag

### Fixed

- Fix bug where `tinty info` doesn't list schemes correctly when the
  `palette` hex values contain a `#` prefix

## [0.22.0] - 2024-10-09

### Added

- Support arguments with `current` subcommand to allow consumers to get
  specific current scheme data
- Add hook string template variable (`%o`) to print the current
  command operation executing the hook

### Fixed

- Fix bug where `tinty build` subcommand doesn't support `filename`
  config.yaml property

## [0.21.0] - 2024-10-01

### Changed

- BREAKING: MacOS breaking change only since Tinty now uses `XDG` paths
  for config and data directories while falling back to `XDG` defaults 
  for these dirs if the environment variables aren't set. This is how 
  Tinty functions on Linux already

## [0.20.1] - 2024-09-25

  default when `tinty apply` is run

  subcommands

  schemes exist

## [0.17.0] - 2024-07-03

  provided image input, with the included functionality of saving this
  scheme file and applying it with `tinty apply`.

  theme file in the repository template instead of the copied version
  under `~/.local/share/tinted-theming/tinty`

### Updated

- Remove unnecessary helper function and optimise code

## [0.10.1] - 2024-02-20

- Fix bug where spaces in config or data directory paths would cause
  `install` and `update` to fail
